example
```js

import brainRetro from 'brain.retro.js';

const input = brainRetro(output, brainNeuralNetwork);
```

For `output` example, or what to expect from `input`, see https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js#examples

There is also a query utility, that allows you to probe deeper into the neural network.  I'll publish it as well if there is interest.
